## Transportation game using transportation vehicles to transport goods across an area.
**Type:** 2D pixel art

**Goal:** Goods are fluctuating in demand and are based on seasons / supply.

**Player Goals:** It is the players responsibility to manage the vehicles used for transportation.

## Vehicles
- Vehicles can be purchased, rented and sold. 
- Vehicles come with different qualities and prices. One Can find a good deal on a vehicle ones in a while but if you take the chance to miss the purchase inspection the vehicle might not be as advertised. 
- Yearly maintenance and licensing is required at different rates based on the size of the vehicle.
- Vehicles sold can be sold for a suggested price or a player set price, the price vehicles are sold at will fluctuate based on demand.
- Vehicles rented can be rented weekly, monthly, yearly or for several years and each of those will cost less at larger lease times. Lower lease times are not available for larger vehicles such as trains, airplanes and ships.

## Supply and Demand
- Supply and demand can be created based on factories, countries, seasons, production, general supply and demand based on the populations wealth and the production state of 1st grade productions
- Oversupply will result in lower goods value and undersupply may result in competition gaining more supply.

## Contracts
- Delivery time consistency affects pay and reputation of company, and may result in unlocking critical timed goods contracts.
- Contracts can be chosen based on company needs. 
- Contracts vary in payout, timeframe, item, reputation effect. 
- Contracts don't stay the same and some may even result in a revenue loss. A successful contract may result in an negotiated contract from the same company, which increases payout, reputation and even negotiable timeframe, but beware! There's a greater penalty for failing those contracts (should only be suitable for experienced players), these contracts are at a different skill level and need equipment and preparness to be able to take them on, but the reward is far greater.
